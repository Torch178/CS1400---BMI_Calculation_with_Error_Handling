# CS1400---BMI_Calculation_with_Error_Handling

This is a simple program which collects input from the user on their height and weight. It then calculates and returns results for their BMI (Body Mass Index).
There is implementation for exception handling using try and catch functions to detect if user input is in a valid format (non-negative, number values).
